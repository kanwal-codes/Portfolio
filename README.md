2. Use a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms
3. Integrate with an email service

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Resume not downloading**: Make sure `resume.pdf` exists in the root directory
2. **Images not loading**: Check file paths and ensure images are in the correct folder
3. **Mobile menu not working**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in the browser
4. **Styling issues**: Check for CSS syntax errors in the browser console

### Browser Console
Open browser developer tools (F12) to see any JavaScript errors or warnings.
